# MaximumFlow-Paintball

Description from open.kattis.com:

Marek and his schoolmates have just finished their studies at the university. 
They wanted to celebrate it with a game of paintball. After an hour of playing a very strange thing happened – everyone had exactly one bullet left. 
Marek, being a very curious person, wanted to know whether it’s possible that everyone will be hit exactly once provided nobody moves.
